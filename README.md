# FinalProject-CS210-F20


Follow these instructions for proper submission and a chance at 
credit.

1.  Put your documentation statement in the file that contains main() or
    equivalent.  The comment block to use is included in the file header.txt
    file in this repo.  Be sure to fill this out thouroughly and do not use
    one of your own design.

2.  Be sure to push your code to the server at least once per coding session
    (every 1/2 hour or so at a minimum).

3.  The .vscode directory contains the default json files.  If you are using
    curses.h or windows.h copy the correct files into this directory.

4.  Add your design document and your latest test plan to the repo and submit
    with your code.

5.  Verify that your repo is complete by doing a final push to GitHub
    and then cloning locally to a different director than your development
    directory.  You should be able to build and run your final project from
    this new location.
    
6.  Do not add files that are created by the build process to your repo (*.exe,
    *.obj, *.lnk, *.pdb).  The .gitignore settings should prevent this.
